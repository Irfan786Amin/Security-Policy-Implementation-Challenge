# Scenario Details

## Company Overview

**XYZ Tech Solutions** employs 150 employees across multiple departments, including software development, IT support, and administration. The company operates a centralized IT infrastructure that includes servers hosting client applications and databases containing sensitive information. Employees have varying levels of technical expertise, from developers to administrative staff.

## Current Challenges

1. **Data Protection**: There's a need to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of client data stored on company servers.

2. **Cybersecurity Risks**: Recent incidents of phishing attacks and malware infections have highlighted vulnerabilities in the company's current security measures.

3. **Compliance Requirements**: The company must comply with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) due to handling client data from European customers, as well as industry-specific regulations.

## Your Tasks

### Policy Development

- Develop policies addressing data encryption, access control, incident response, and employee security awareness.
- Policies should be clear, enforceable, and aligned with industry standards (e.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework) and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR).

### Implementation Plan

- Create a phased implementation plan detailing how policies will be rolled out across different departments.
- Include training sessions for employees on new policies, communication strategies, and compliance monitoring measures.

### Testing and Validation

- Conduct tabletop exercises to simulate cybersecurity incidents (e.g., phishing attack, data breach) and test the effectiveness of incident response procedures.
- Validate policy enforcement mechanisms and ensure they align with company operations and culture.

### Documentation and Reporting

- Prepare formal documentation of policies, procedures, and implementation plans.
- Create a comprehensive report or presentation summarizing the rationale for policy choices, compliance with regulations, and projected impact on cybersecurity posture.

### Continuous Improvement

- Establish a process for regular review and update of policies based on feedback from incident responses, audits, and emerging threats.
- Foster a culture of cybersecurity awareness and continuous improvement across the organization.

## Key Deliverables

1. **Policy Documentation**: Detailed policies and procedures covering data protection, access control, incident response, and employee security awareness.

2. **Implementation Plan**: Phased rollout plan with timelines, training schedules, and communication strategies.

3. **Testing and Validation Results**: Reports from tabletop exercises and validation of policy enforcement mechanisms.

4. **Comprehensive Report**: Document summarizing the entire project, including rationale, compliance with standards, and impact assessment.

This scenario will challenge you to demonstrate your expertise in cybersecurity policy development, implementation, and management within a dynamic organizational context. It emphasizes your ability to align technical solutions with business goals while ensuring compliance and fostering a secure operational environment.
